# DNA sequence analysis pipeline

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/dna_flow.png" width="400px"></div>

 - Can start from both bam and fastq files.
 - Suitable for whole genome sequencing analysis (as well as exome sequencing analysis).
 - Carefully devised mutation filtering steps enables sensitive and accurate somatic mutation detection.
 - GenomonSV detects mid-range indels (30bp - 300bp) such as FLT3-ITD as well as long range structural variations.

# RNA sequence analysis pipeline

<div align="center"><img src="/assets/images/rna_flow.png" width="400px"></div>

We renovated gene fusion detection (from Genomon-Fusion) to a new approach fusionfusion

 - Filtering chimeric read generated by STAR.
 - Computationally far more efficient compared to Genomon-Fusion (~200 holds)
 - Sensitive even for short read length (~50bp).
 - Can easily change to other alignment tools (such as map-splice2, tophat2) by option.
 - Integrative analysis with DNA and RNA sequence data (e.g., detecting somatic mutations causing splicing changes) is coming out soon!!

# Automatic construction of interactice analysis graphs.

 - Graphs are able to be sorted, selected.
 - Extract some samples of your interest.
